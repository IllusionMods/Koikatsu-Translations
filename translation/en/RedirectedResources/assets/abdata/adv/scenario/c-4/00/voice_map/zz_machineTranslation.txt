「あら、どうしたの？　先生に用事？」=“Oh, what's the matter?　You wanted to see me?”
「職員室に入るのって緊張する？　ふふっ、私も学生の頃はそうだったかも」=“Are you nervous about going into the teacher's lounge?　I used to be like that when I was in school.”
「やっぱりきみはどこで見ても目立つなぁ」=“No matter where you look, you stand out”
「ねぇ、きみが今までに通った学園と比べて、女学園ってどう？　やっぱり全然違うのかしら？」=“I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a job at the school.　Is it different?”
「廊下、綺麗でしょう？　うちの学生たちって掃除はすごく真面目にやるの。男の子ってどうなのかしら？」=“Isn't the hallway clean?　My students are so diligent about cleaning. What about the boys?”
「うーん、男の子も一人きりだと……廊下で騒ぐことも出来ないわよね。あ、ううん、男の子に対する私の勝手なイメージなんだけど……」=“Well, boys can't make a fuss in the ... hallway if they're alone, can they? Oh, no, it's just my own image of boys...”
「忘れ物忘れ物！　もー、たまには先生も忘れ物します！」=“I'll never forget... I'll never forget...　I'm sure I'll never forget anything!”
「教室って……何だかちょっと落ち着いちゃうの。みんなの笑顔が見られるからかしら」=“Classrooms are ... a little calming for some reason. I think it's because I can see the smiles on everyone's faces.”
「え？　ここにいると先生っぽい？　もう、先生はいつでも先生です！」=“What?　Do I look like a teacher here?　You're a teacher now, you'll always be a teacher!”
「女学園だけあって、学食のメニューもお洒落なものが多いでしょう」=“Because it's a girls' school, the school cafeteria menu has many stylish dishes.”
「私のお気に入りはペスカトーレだけど……男の子には足りないかしら？」=“My favorite is pescatore, but not enough for ... the boys?”
「ふふっ、きみだったら二人前くらい食べちゃいそうね」=“I'm sure you could eat two of those.”
「あら、今日はここでお勉強？　先生、真面目な子は好きですよ」=“Oh, are you studying here today?　Oh, you're studying here today?”
「私もちょっと借りたい本があって……ううん、小説じゃなくて雑誌の新刊よ」=“I also have a book I'd like to borrow for a bit: ... No, it's not a novel, it's a new issue of a magazine.”
「図書室って静かでいいわよね。私、司書にも憧れてるのよ」=“I like the quiet in the library. I've always wanted to be a librarian.”
