「あ、きみ、ちょっといい？」=“Can I talk to you for a second?”
「はい、何でしょう？」=“Yes, sir?”
「ううん、最近ね、クラスの子からきみの話をたくさん聞くの。馴染めるように頑張ってるみたいね」=“No, I've been hearing a lot about you from my classmates lately. It seems like you're trying really hard to fit in.”
「あはは、一応はうまくやってるつもりですが……やっぱり慣れなくて。結構戸惑ってます」=“I think I'm doing okay, but ... I'm still not used to it. I'm pretty confused.”
「ふふっ、それは仕方ないわよ。周りには女の子しかいないんですもの」=“Oh, that's not a good idea. There's only girls around.”
「それに……私だって意外と戸惑うのよ？　男の子と会話するのって」=“And ... I'm also more confused than I thought, you know?　Talking to boys...”
「え？　もしかして俺ってそんなに話しかけづらいオーラを出してますか？」=“What?　Am I giving off an aura that makes me difficult to talk to?”
「そういうわけじゃないわ。なんて言うか……えーっと……その逆で……話しかけやすすぎて戸惑う……って感じなのかも……」=“It's not like that. I don't know, it's like ... uh... the opposite of that, it's like ... it's too easy to talk to you, it's too confusing... Maybe it's like... ...”
「話しかけやすくて？」=“You're easy to talk to, aren't you?”
「そう。なかなか男の子と知り合う機会がない中で、いきなり距離が縮まるというか……仲良くなれるというか……」=“Okay. It's not often you get the chance to get to know a boy, but suddenly you get closer or ... get to know each other or ...”
「私なんて、きみが転入するって聞いた時、すっごく身構えてたんだから」=“I was so defensive when I heard you were moving in.”
「えー、そうなんですか？」=“Oh, yeah?”
「そうよ。だって不良の子が来たらどうしようって思ったもの」=“That's right. I mean, what if some punk comes in here and he's like...”
「ははは、先生って心配性なんですね」=“You're a bit of a worrier, aren't you?”
「ふふっ、そうかも。でも……本当にきみで良かった。これからもみんなのことをよろしくね」=“I'm not sure if that's true. I'm really glad it's you. I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to make it work for you.”
「はい！　頑張ります！」=“Yes, sir!　I'll do my best!”
