[H名]のウェディングドレス姿を見て、模擬挙式のモデルをやった日のことを思い出す。=Seeing [H名] in her wedding dress reminds me of the day I modeled for a mock wedding.
あの時の[H名]のドレス姿は本当に綺麗で、何だかどぎまぎしたことを覚えている。=I remember how beautiful [H名] looked in her dress at that time and I was kind of nervous about it.
（――なんて、昔だけじゃなくて今もときめいちゃってるんだけどな）=(I'm not just saying that I used to have a crush on you, but I still do.)
（うん……本当に、本当に綺麗だ）=(Yeah... it's really, really beautiful!)
「はい、誓います♪」=“Yes, I swear.”
「……くすっ、くすくす……」=“... giggle, giggle...”
「えっ、何、どうしたの？」=“What, what, what's wrong?”
「だって……顔。ガチガチなんだもん。お、おかしくて……ふふ……」=“Because ... face. I'm so stiff. Oh, it's funny and ... phew ...”
「あ、当たり前だよ。俺にとっても[H名]にとっても、一世一代のことだし、責任も重大だから」=“Oh, of course. It's a once in a lifetime deal for me and for [H名], and it's a big responsibility.”
「[H名]はあまり緊張してないみたいだね……」=“[H名] doesn't seem too nervous ...”
「だって、今日は幸せな日だもん。籍自体はちょっと前に入れたけど、今日はそのお祝いみたいなものだから、楽しくてしょうがないの♪」=“Because today is a happy day. We got registered a while ago, but today is kind of a celebration, so I'm really excited about it.”
「そ、そうだよね……」=“That's right...”
（実を言うと、さっきからお父さんの視線が怖いんだよな……もちろん祝福してくれてるし、何度もお酒を飲んで打ち解けてはいるんだけど……）=(To tell you the truth, I've been afraid of the way my dad looks at me since a while ago... Of course he's given me his blessing, and we've had a lot of drinks and gotten to know each other...)
（[H名]は本当に家族と仲がいい子だから、お父さんも気が気じゃないんだろうな。そんな子をもらう男としては、やっぱり緊張しちゃうよ……）=([H名] is a really good girl with her family, so I'm sure her dad isn't too thrilled with her. As a guy who gets a girl like that, I'm still nervous...)
（いや、幸せにしたい気持ちに嘘はないんだ……でも、俺は、絶対に[H名]を幸せにできるのかな……幸せな家庭を築いていけるんだろうか……）=(No, I'm not lying about my desire to make you happy... but I wonder if I'll ever be able to make [H名] happy... and build a happy family... ...)
「じゃ、恩返ししないとね」=“Well, I guess I owe you one.”
「……恩返し？　なに、いきなり」=“... repay the favor?　What, out of nowhere?”
「私ね、あの学園に通ってたときは、自分にあまり自信が持てなかったの。今思えば贅沢だなーって思うけど、どこにでもいる平凡な子だって思ってた」=“I was never very confident about myself when I went to that school. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a new one, but I'm sure it's a good idea to have a new one.”
「あの時のみんな、すごく個性的だったよね？　だから余計ね……でも、そんなときに、キミが『一番綺麗』って言ってくれたの」=“I was so excited to see her, she was so different from her normal self.　That made it all the more special... But then you told me I was the most beautiful girl you'd ever seen.”
「一番、って……あの時の私にとって、本当に縁のない言葉だったの。だから……人生で一番好きになったキミに一番綺麗って言ってもらえて、嬉しかったの」=“The most is a word that I really didn't have a connection with at that ... time. So I was happy that you, the person I love most in ... my life, told me I was the most beautiful person you've ever seen.”
「だから、恩返し。キミはね、私にとって一番格好いい人だよ。一番って、他の誰かじゃ絶対ダメで、なかなかなれないけど……」=“So return the favor. You're the coolest person I've ever met. I'm the coolest person I've ever met, and it's hard to be the coolest person you've ever met when you can't be anyone else...”
「誰かと比べて一番じゃなくて、キミだけなの。二番も三番もいない、キミが一番なだけなの。一番格好いいよ。だから……大丈夫だよ！」=“I don't want to be number one. I want you. There's no second or third best. You're just the best. You're the coolest. So ... it's okay!”
（！　……恩返し、か。たしかに昔、[H名]が言ってたな。俺が一番って言って自信がついたって……これは、たしかに、クるな……）=(!　... giving back, huh? I'm sure [H名] told me once that I'm the best. I'm the best," she said, "and that gives me confidence... This is definitely cool...)
「……うん、大丈夫だね。[H名]が俺をそうやって信じてくれる限り、俺は頑張れる」=“...Yeah, it's okay, as long as [H名] believes in me like I believe in her, I can keep going.”
「これからも一番しかいない一番同士、一緒に幸せになろう」=“I want you to give me the happiness of giving birth to your child.”
「ん、っん……」=“Nnnn...”
「……好きだよ♡」=“I love ... you, handsome.”
「……俺、色々気にしてたけど、なんか大丈夫な気がしてきた」=“...I've been worried about a lot of things, but I'm starting to feel okay about it.”
「おっ、その調子、その調子！　何でも肩に力が入ってると、だめになっちゃうから……そういうときは、私が肩たたきしてあげる♪」=“Oh, that's it. That's it. That's it.　Anything with a chip on its shoulder is a bad thing... I'll give you a pat on the shoulder for that.”
「だから……私のこと、ずっと信じててね♪　ダーリン♡」=“So ... you'll always have to trust me, darlin' handsome.”
