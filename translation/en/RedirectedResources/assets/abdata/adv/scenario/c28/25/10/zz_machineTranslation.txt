「お主がやっている珍妙な部活じゃな。わしも、ちと興味があってな」=“I'm glad you said that, because I'm already  glad you said that. I'm also a bit interested in it.”
「ち、珍妙って……確かに珍しいとは思うけど、おかしい部活ではないよ？」=“It's certainly unusual..., but it's not a strange club activity, okay?”
「ほう……して、どのような部活なのじゃ？　お主と話せばよいだけなのか？」=“What kind of club is it?　So, what kind of club is it?”
「まあ、それもあるんだけど、あとはスキンシップとかかな」=“Well, there's that, too, but then there's the skinship.”
「スキンシップじゃと？　それは……お主と、ということか？」=“You call that skinship?　You mean with ... you?”
「もちろん、無理にとは言わないけど……キミさえよければ、どうかな？」=“Of course, I don't mean to impose, but ... if it's all right with you, I don't know.”
「……まぁ、わしもやぶさかではないが。お主がそう言うのであれば……喜んで入るのじゃ」=“... Well, I wouldn't blame you. If that's what you say... I'm willing to go in.”
