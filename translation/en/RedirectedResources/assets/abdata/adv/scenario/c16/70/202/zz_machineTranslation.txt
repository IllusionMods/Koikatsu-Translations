「ねぇ、変なウサギがスタンプラリー配ってたよ。俺達もやってみる？」=“Hey, there's a weird bunny giving out stamps. You want us to try?”
「変なって、あれはここのマスコットよ？　フフッ、そんな風に言ったら可哀相よ」=“That's weird, that's our mascot, okay?　You're so sad when you talk to me like that.”
「はは、そうだね。で、どうしよっか？　景品も貰えるみたいだけど、スタンプラリーやる？」=“Ha ha, you're right. So, what should we do?　I heard we can get some prizes, do you want to do the stamp rally?”
「遊園地の事を良く知るにはいいかもしれないわね。オススメの場所にスタンプがあるのだろうし」=“It's a good way to get to know the amusement park better. I'm sure there's a stamp on the recommended place.”
「かな？　もしかしたら逆で、人気のない場所に敢えてスタンプを置いて、人を呼んでるのかもしれないよ？」=“I don't know.　Maybe it's the other way around. Maybe you dare to put your stamp on an unpopular place and invite people over?”
「それはそれで面白そうね。とにかくやってみましょうか。何事も経験よ」=“That sounds interesting. I'll give it a try anyway. Everything's an experience.”
「ほら、次はあっちよ。早く行きましょう」=“Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, let's go.”
「ちょっと待って……これ、結構歩き回ってしんどい……」=“Wait a minute... This is a lot of walking around. It's hard...”
「もう、バテるのが早いわよ？　まだスタンプは３つ目、折り返しにもなってないわ」=“You're getting cold feet, you know that?　You're on your third stamp. You haven't even turned the page yet.”
「わかってるけど、遊園地って思ってるより広いから、少し休憩しよう？」=“I know, but the amusement park is a lot bigger than you think.”
「仕方ないわねぇ。その間に最短で回れるコースを考えておくわ」=“I'm not sure what to do. I'll think of the quickest way around in the meantime.”
「ありがとう。そうしてくれると助かるよ」=“Thank you. That'd be great.”
「フフッ、これは休憩ポイントも考えておいた方がいいわね。それもかなり多めに」=“I'm sorry. And quite a few more.”
「おねがいします……お荷物にならないように、頑張って歩くよ」=“Please ... I'll walk as fast as I can so I don't become baggage.”
「えっと……休憩しない？　足がその、疲れちゃって……」=“Um... ..., can we take a break?　My feet are, you know, they're tired...”
「あっ、ごめん。スタンプラリーに夢中になって、歩くペースを考えてなかった」=“Oh, I'm sorry. I was so caught up in the stamp rally that I didn't think about the pace of the walk.”
「なるべくアナタのペースに合わせようとしたのだけど。やっぱり男子のペースには追い付けないわね」=“I'm not going to be able to get a job here. I can't keep up with the pace of boys after all.”
「むしろ途中まで合わせてくれていた事が驚きだよ。もう少し早く、俺が気付くべきだったね……」=“I'm rather surprised you've been able to keep up with me along the way. I should have figured it out a little sooner...”
「いいの、気にしないで。目的地に向かって一直線に歩いて行くアナタ、ちょっとカッコよかったわよ」=“It's okay. Don't worry about it. You were kind of cool, walking in a straight line towards your destination.”
「そ、そう？　ただ景品が欲しかっただけかもしれないよ？」=“Oh, yeah?　Maybe he just wanted the prize, you know?”
「それでもよ。何か目標があるというのは良い事だわ。さて、少し休憩できたし、スタンプラリーを再開しましょうか」=“Still. It's nice to have a goal. Well, now that we've had a break, we can resume the stamp rally.”
「待って待って、いくらなんでも休憩が短すぎるって。焦る必要はないから、もう少し休んでからにしよう」=“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.”
