「いいよー。でも何するの？　かくれんぼ？　それとも鬼ごっこかな？」=“It's fine. But what are you going to do?　Hide and seek?　Or play tag?”
「２人で鬼ごっこっていうのもね……まずは何やるかを考えよう」=“Or we could play tag... Let's think about what we're going to do first.”
「２人でできる運動……うーん、なんだろうねー」=“Exercise that the two of us can do together... hmmm, I wonder what that would be...”
