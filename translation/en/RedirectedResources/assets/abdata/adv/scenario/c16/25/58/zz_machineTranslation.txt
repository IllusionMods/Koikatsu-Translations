「えぇ、当たり前よ！　この前の借りをきっちり返してみせるわ！」=“Yeah, of course!　I'm gonna pay you back for what you did to me last time!”
「あー、はは、流石に疲れてきたね……ちょっと頑張りすぎたかな……」=“Ah, ha, I'm getting tired of the stone... I think I tried a little too hard...”
「うっ、そんな事ない……わよ？　でもちょっと……休憩しましょうか……」=“Ugh, that's not true..., okay?　But let's take a ... break...”
