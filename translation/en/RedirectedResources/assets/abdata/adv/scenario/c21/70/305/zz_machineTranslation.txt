「あ～、聞いてもいい曲だけど、自分で歌ってもグッとくるなぁ……ん？　[H名]、次の曲入れてないの？」=“Oh, it's a nice song to listen to, but it's also very moving when you sing it yourself... Hmm?　[H名], you didn't put the next song in?”
「え？　あ、うん……そのぉ……ねね、さっき黝子ちゃんが言ってた『お楽しみですな』って……その、やっぱり、そういう意味？」=“What? - Uh-huh.　Oh, yeah..., you know..., when you said earlier that it's going to be fun..., did you mean that?”
「あー、えっと……たぶん、ここでエッチするって思われた……いや、気分が盛り上がったらエッチしてもいいよって意味かも。がんばれ、みたいな」=“Uh, uh... maybe they thought we were gonna have sex here ... no, I mean, maybe it means you can have sex with me if you're feeling up to it. Like, good luck.”
「で、でも……ここって、カラオケだよ？」=“But, but ... this is karaoke, right?”
「友達に聞いたことない？　カラオケでエッチしちゃうカップル」=“Haven't you heard that from your friends?　Couples who have sex at karaoke.”
「う……うん。というか昨日、カラオケで彼氏とエッチしたって子から、色んな話、聞いたばっかりだったんだよね……」=“I'm so sorry, but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. I mean, I just heard a lot of stories yesterday from a girl who said she had sex with her boyfriend at karaoke...”
（もしかして、ずっと意識してたのかな……だとしたら、すごくエロいけど……誘ってみようか……）=(I'm not sure if I've always been aware of it..., but if so, it's very erotic... I should ask her out...)
「じゃあ……してみたい？　俺は、してみたい」=“So you want to do ...?　I do.”
「でも、ドアの向こう、廊下だよ？　大丈夫かな……あ、キミとしたくないって意味じゃなくて、むしろ……その……私も、したい……けど……」=“But, you know, it's a hallway behind that door, right?　I don't ... know if you're okay with that, it's not that I don't want to do it with you, it's just that ... that ... I do... ...but ...”
「店員さんがＯＫくれたから、きっと大丈夫だよ。いや、大丈夫じゃなくても、俺のココ、もう我慢できないって」=“The shopkeeper gave me the OK, so I'm sure it'll be fine. No, even if it's not okay... my coco can't take it anymore.”
「わっ、キミのおちんちん、もう大きくなってる……あのね、恥ずかしいけど、カラオケでエッチするの意識してたから……その、私の……アソコも、もう、ね……」=“Wow, your penis is already getting bigger... You know, I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I was aware that we were going to have sex at karaoke... Well, my... ...pussy already, you know...”
「待って。その先は自分で確かめるから言わなくていいよ」=“Wait. You don't have to tell me. I'll find out for myself.”
「……けど、初めてのエッチがこんな場所なんて、ちょっとムードがなさすぎるかな。やめておく？」=“... but I think it's a little too moody to have sex for the first time in a place like this. Should I stop?”
「えっ……あ、そうだよね？　カラオケって楽しく歌うところだし、え、エッチするところじゃないよね？　あはは、黝子ちゃんったら、冗談きついな～」=“What? ... Oh, that's right, isn't it?　I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm not sure what you're talking about.　Haha, you're such a jokester, Kurashiko~!”
「[H名]が嫌がることはしたくないし、普通に歌おうか。じゃあ、次、[H名]の番だよ」=“I don't want to do anything [H名] won't like. Okay, [H名], you're up next.”
「う、うん……あ、でも～ね～……別に、嫌ってわけじゃー……ない、かも？　私たち、付き合ってるし、こういうのって、気持ちが盛り上がった時にするのかなって」=“I'm not saying I don't like it..., but it's not that I don't like it..., it's just that I don't like it.　I'm not saying I don't like it,, but it's not that I don't like it...”
「じゃあ……少し強引に誘っても、問題なかったり……して？」=“So, if I ask you out a little too forcefully, will that be a problem?”
「た、試してみる？　ああっえっと、今のは恋の駆け引きとかそういうのじゃなくて、ただの照れ隠しっていうか、恥ずかしいっていうか……」=“I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.　Oh, um, it's not like I'm trying to make love or anything, it's just that I'm embarrassed...”
「大丈夫、分かってるよ。あとは俺に任せて」=“It's okay, I know. I'll take care of the rest.”
「……うん。優しく、してね？」=“... Yeah. Be nice, okay?”
