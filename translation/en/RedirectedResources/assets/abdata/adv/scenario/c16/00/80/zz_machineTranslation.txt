「うぅ～～んっ！　凄く解放的ね。ここで食べたら何でも美味しそう」=“Unh!　It's so liberating. Everything looks so good when we eat here.”
「ホントだね。今日は購買だったけど、お弁当とか作ってきたら最高だろうね」=“I'd love to. I know it was just a purchase today, but it would be great if you made me lunch or something.”
「あら？　それはリクエスト？　仕方ないわね。今度気が向いたら作って来てあげる」=“Oh?　Is that a request?　I don't have a choice. I'll go make you something next time I feel like it.”
「えっ！　ほ、ホントに！　楽しみだなぁ……」=“Oh, my God!　Oh, really!　I'm looking forward to it...”
