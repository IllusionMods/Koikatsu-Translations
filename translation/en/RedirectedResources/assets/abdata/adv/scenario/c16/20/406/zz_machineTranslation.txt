「うわ、外が暗くなってきてる。かなり話し込んじゃったみたいだね」=“I've been talking to him for a while now. It's getting dark outside.”
「そうね、そろそろ出ないと、お店の迷惑になりそうだわ」=“I'm sure you're right. I should probably get out of here. I'm going to get in trouble at the store.”
「うん、じゃあ俺が先に会計してきちゃうね」=“I'm going to go pay the bill first.”
「ええ、お願いするわ。後で私の分は払うから」=“Yes, please. I'll pay for mine later.”
「いいって、いつもお世話になってる分、ここは俺が奢るよ」=“No, I'll buy you a drink for all the help you've given me.”
「んぅ……男の人にそう言われたら、素直に引き下がる方がいいとは聞いたけど……本当にいいの？」=“I've heard it's better to back off when a man says that to you, but ... are you sure?”
「うん、その噂通りだよ。男が奢るって言った時は、一言お礼だけくれれば十分！」=“Yeah, it's true what they say. When a man offers to buy you a drink, a word of thanks is all you need!”
