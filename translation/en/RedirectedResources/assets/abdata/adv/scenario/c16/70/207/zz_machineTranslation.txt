「夜景、本当に綺麗だったわね。これなら何度でも見たくなるわ」=“That was really beautiful, the night view. I could go on and on with this.”
「見たくなったら、また来ようよ。何度だって付き合うからさ」=“If you want to see it, we can come back. I'll go out with you as many times as you want.”
「ありがとう。それじゃあ今日は、そろそろ帰らないとかしら」=“Thank you. Well, I guess I should be going home for the day.”
「うん、最後に観覧車も乗れたし、今日はもう思い残す事はないかな」=“Yeah, I got to ride the Ferris wheel one last time, so I guess I don't have any more regrets today.”
「そうね、もう周りの人もまばらだし、堂々と手を繋いで帰りましょう」=“The actuality that you can't get a good deal more than a couple of minutes of sleep, you're going to need to have a lot more than a couple of hours of sleep.”
