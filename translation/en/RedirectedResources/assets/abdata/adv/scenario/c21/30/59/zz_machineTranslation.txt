「ねね、今日のデート、友達に話してもいい？」=“Can I tell my friends about today's date?”
「すっごく楽しかったから♪　あ、でも、みんなも行きたがっちゃうかな。やっぱり言ーわない♪　それじゃ、またね」=“The actuality that you can't get a good deal more than a few of these, you'll be able to't get a good deal more than a few of these. I'm not going to say it... I'll see you later.”
