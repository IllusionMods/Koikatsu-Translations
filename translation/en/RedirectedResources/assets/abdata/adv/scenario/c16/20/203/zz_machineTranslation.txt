「そろそろ閉園時間も迫ってきたわね。皆帰り始めているようだけど、私達はどうしましょうか？」=“It's almost closing time. Everyone seems to be leaving, what should we do?”
CHOICE:『最後に観覧車に乗りたいな』=CHOICE: "I want to ride the Ferris wheel one last time."
CHOICE:『俺達も帰った方がよさそうかな』=CHOICE: "Maybe we should go home too"
「最後に観覧車に乗ろうよ。今日のシメって感じでさ」=“How about we go on the Ferris wheel at the end? We could take a Ferris wheel ride and call it a day.”
「そうね。ゆっくりできて丁度いいかも」=“Yeah, I know. It's good to take it slow.”
「そうそう、最後にゆっくり、今日のデートを振り返る的な感じで」=“Oh, yeah, yeah, at the end, slowly, like a recap of today's date.”
「それなら、上から見るのは効率的ね。園内全部を見渡せれば、次に来た時に行きたい場所も見つかるだろうし」=“Then it's more efficient to see it from above. If we can see the whole park, we can find where we want to go the next time we come back.”
「うんうん、じゃあ早速行こうか！　人が少ないから、並ばないで乗れそうだよ」=“Okay, well, let's get going!　There's not many people here, so we won't have to wait in line.”
「右へならえってわけじゃないけど、俺達も帰ろうか」=“I'm sorry for everything I've done to you, but I'm not going to go right back to you.”
「群衆心理というやつね。まぁ、十分楽しんだし、もう帰るのには賛成よ」=“It's called mob mentality. Well, I've had enough fun. I'm ready to go home.”
「うん、ギリギリで遊んで疲れちゃうよりは、余力を残して帰った方がいいよね」=“Yeah, it's better to go home with a little extra energy than to play last minute and get tired.”
「ごもっとも。はしゃぎ過ぎて、明日動けなくなりましたでは、話にならないもの」=“You're right. I'm not going to be able to move tomorrow because I'm too excited.”
「はは、確かにね。それじゃあ、最後にお土産くらいは見ていこうか」=“Haha, you're right. Well then, let's at least look at some souvenirs at the end of the day.”
