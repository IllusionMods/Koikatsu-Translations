「それっ！　トスあげるわよ！」=“That's it!　I'll give you a toss!”
「ナイストス！　しゃッ、これなら！」=“Nice toss!　I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing.”
「わっ、ナイススパイク！　アナタ、バレー上手なのね」=“Wow, nice spike!　You're a good ballet player.”
「今のはトスが良かったんだよ。俺達いいコンビかもね」=“That was a good toss. Maybe we'd make a good team.”
「ふふっ、えぇ、そうかも。でも男女じゃチームを組めないのよね。ちょっと惜しいわ」=“Yeah, I guess so. But you can't have a boy and a girl team. That's a shame.”
