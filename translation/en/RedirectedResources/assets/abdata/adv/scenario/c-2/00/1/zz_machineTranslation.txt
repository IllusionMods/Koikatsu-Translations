「ここでの学園生活に、少しは慣れてきたようね。授業態度や成績も悪くないようだし」=“I'm sure you've gotten used to school life here a little bit. You seem to be adjusting to school life here a little better. Your grades and attitude in class aren't too bad.”
「環境がガラッと変わりましたけど、周りに付いていけるようになんとか……という感じです」=“The environment has changed drastically, but I've managed to ... keep up with the people around me.”
「結果が出ている以上問題ないわ」=“I don't have a problem with that, as long as the results are good.”
「でも、これで満足せずにさらに上を目指しなさい？」=“But you're not satisfied with this, so why don't you try to improve on it?”
「気を抜いたら、もしくは現状維持で良しとしたら、落ちていく一方だから」=“Because if you let up, or if you're happy with the status quo, you're just gonna keep falling.”
「心に留めておきます。これからも頑張ります！」=“I'll keep that in mind. I'll keep trying!”
