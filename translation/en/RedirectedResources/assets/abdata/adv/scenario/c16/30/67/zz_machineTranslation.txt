「ごめんなさい。大分待たせちゃったわね……」=“I'm sorry. I'm sorry I made you wait so long...”
「気にしてないよ。なんか待ってる時間も幸せでさ」=“I don't mind. I don't mind. I'm just so happy to be waiting for you.”
「そ、そう……ならよかっ……うーん、よくはない……わよね？　待たせた事には変わりないんだし」=“That's... that's... that's... that's good... that's... that's... that's not good... that's... that's not good.　It doesn't change the fact that I made you wait.”
「ははっ、難しく考え過ぎだよ。さ、帰ろっか」=“Haha, you're thinking too hard. Well, let's go home.”
