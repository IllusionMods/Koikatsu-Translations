「お待たせ。あー、５分前じゃ遅かったかな？　結構待った？」=“Here you go. Ah, was I too late five minutes ago?　Was it a long wait?”
「いえ、敢えて言う程の時間は待ってないわよ。アナタは遅刻しなかったんだし、変な負い目も感じる必要はないわ」=“No, I'm not waiting for you to tell me how much time I have to wait. I'm not going to wait too long to tell you. You weren't late, so there's no need to feel guilty.”
（うわ、これ絶対かなり待ってたやつだ……）=(Wow, this is definitely the one I've been waiting for...)
「さ、参考までに何分前から居たのか教えてもらっていい？」=“Now, just for reference, can you tell me how long you've been here?”
「時間の価値観を共有しておくのは良い事だと思うけど……恥ずかしいから言わないわ。本当に気にしなくていいから」=“I think it's good to share the value of time, but ... I won't tell you because I'm embarrassed. I really don't need to worry about it.”
「そ、そう？　なら、早速デートを始めようか」=“Oh, yeah?　Well, then, let's get started on our date.”
（恥ずかしくて言えないって……予想の倍くらいは待ってそうだなぁ……）=(She's too shy to say it ... I guess she's waiting twice as long as I expected ...)
