「……ねえ、私たちって愛称で呼び合わないけど、仲悪いのかしら？」=“...We don't call each other by our nicknames, do you think we don't get along?”
「いや、そういうことはないと思うけど……どうしたの？」=“No, I don't think so... What's wrong?”
「……雑誌に、恋人は愛称で呼び合うものだ、って書いてたから」=“...I read in a magazine that lovers are supposed to call each other by their nicknames, so...”
「はは、そんなこと気にしてたんだ」=“Ha ha, I didn't know you cared about that”
「むっ、そんなことって……私、一生懸命あなたの愛称を考えたのに……」=“Mh, that's not possible... I tried so hard to come up with a nickname for you...”
「えっ、考えてくれたの？　なになに、呼んでみてよ！」=“What, you thought about it?　Oh, come on, call me!”
「き、期待されると困るのだけれど……。えっと……[Pあだ名]」=“I'm not sure if I'm making [P名] feel good, but I'm not sure if I'm ... making him feel good. I'm not sure if I'm doing as well as I'd like...[Pあだ名]”
「おお……なんか恋人同士っぽい呼び方だね」=“Oh... you call me like we're lovers.”
「だって恋人同士だもの。……ほら、そっちも呼んでみてよ」=“Because we're lovers... Come on, you can call me that too.”
「わ、わかった……えーと……[Hあだ名]」=“I can't exorcise you, but I'll take care of it.”
「……まあまあってところね」=“...I'm so-so, I suppose.”
「……顔が赤いよ？　[Hあだ名]」=“...You're blushing, aren't you?　[Hあだ名].”
「あなただって……ああもう、柄でもないことをするものじゃないわね……」=“You're not the one ... to do something so out of character...”
「ちょっと照れくさかったけど、俺は嬉しかったよ」=“It was a little embarrassing, but it made me happy.”
「……それじゃあ、また呼んでみてもいいかしら？」=“... so can I call you back then?”
「うん、もちろんだよ」=“Yeah, of course.”
